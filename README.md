==================================================
Simply track time for tasks in your browser.



### Problems found with existing trackers...
- Often add a task I started minutes or hours ago
- It's easy to forget your task timer is running
- Data often needs to be transferred to some official system for payroll, etc.
- Tasks are often dictated by a ticketing/issues system, and redundantly
created in a time tracker app
- Sometimes mulitple tasks are being worked on in tandom.


### Solutions
- new tasks offer shortcuts to start with a specific amount of time
    - 5, 15, 30, 60 min (maybe clicking multiple times is additive)
- running tasks can optionally "nag" the user every (15, have the option to
"nag" at every 15, 30 or 60 minutes.
    - if a nag is not responded to within 5min, it automatically stops itself
- provide an export option to output tracked data (JSON)
    - possbily find ways to integrate into common ticketing/issue systems
- allow user to log mulitiple tasks at once, so they can work on them and log them
easily.  The task times will not be additive during these periods.
